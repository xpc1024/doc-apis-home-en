## API Documentation Generation

API documentation serves as a communication tool between developers and between developers and clients. By utilizing doc-apis, one can swiftly and accurately generate API documentation, enhancing development efficiency, reducing costs, and improving quality. It supports generating interface connection documents for three platforms—Web, iOS, and Android—and can produce API documentation in various formats such as HTML and Markdown.

During the early stages of development, backend developers can define only the essential details of an API, such as input/output parameters and request methods/URLs, without implementing the interface itself, allowing for immediate documentation creation to facilitate quick coordination with frontend developers. Compared to conventional methods of documentation generation, this significantly reduces waiting times for frontend developers, aiding companies in cost reduction and efficiency enhancement.

## Interface Debugging

The generated API documentation isn't just for front-end and back-end alignment; it also enables online interface debugging, providing a convenient method for both front-end and back-end developers to quickly and easily test interfaces. It offers debugging capabilities akin to those of Swagger and Postman.

## Code Standard Review

The framework leverages code comments and interface parameter models to automatically generate API documentation. Should any interface deviate from coding standards, architects or team leaders can easily identify non-conforming interfaces through the generated documentation page, pinpointing the developers responsible for the code mess and urging them to make corrections. Over time, this leads to higher project quality and more maintainable and transferable code.
