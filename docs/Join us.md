If you encounter any issues while using doc-apis or have inquiries, feel free to join our chat group to provide feedback or engage in discussions. The group consists of peers, and we've established a friendly platform where members can exchange technical knowledge as well as discuss fitness-related topics. Welcome aboard!Please note that WeChat QR codes are valid for only 7 days, hence we cannot post a permanent one here. Instead, you can add my WeChat by sending a friend request with the note 'doc-apis', and I will personally invite you to the group. For those who prefer not to use WeChat, we also have a QQ group, although responses might be slower there; our primary communication channel is the WeChat group.
