## Interface debug

After the API documentation is generated, open the index page via a browser and navigate to the specific interface you need to debug through the left-hand directory.

The default global request URL is localhost:8080,, which can be modified through the Servers input box at the top of the page.

Global request headers can be configured on the homepage. Once configured, all interfaces will carry these headers when making requests. If special configurations are needed for specific interfaces, you may set their headers individually. Headers configured for a specific interface only apply to that interface and have the highest priority. In case of a key conflict between global headers and those set for a specific interface, the latter takes precedence.

:::tip tip tip
Due to the requirement of maintaining a zero-intrusion characteristic, necessary information cannot be stored in the database via backend interfaces. Therefore, all header information is stored in cookies. If you inadvertently clear your browser cookies, you'll need to reconfigure the header information.
:::


The request method of an interface is determined by the annotations on the interface itself, with the backend code's specification as the standard. For example, if the @GetMapping󠁪 annotation is specified for interface A in the backend's Controller, then the request method for that interface is GET. Similarly, other annotations like @PostMapping󠁪, @PutMapping󠁪, @DeleteMapping󠁪, @PatchMapping󠁪, and @RequestMapping󠁪 are also effective. When a request is initiated, the appropriate request type is automatically invoked, along with parameter types such as URL parameters, form data, or JSON, as determined by the backend code. As long as the backend code adheres to the standards, no additional configuration or operation is needed; the framework will automatically specify the parameter type.Its usage is essentially similar to Swagger and Postman, very user-friendly; hence, further elaboration is unnecessary. Gentlemen, please refer directly to the screenshots for a visual demonstration.
