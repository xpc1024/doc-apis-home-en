## @DocApi

By default, doc-apis generates documentation for all interfaces within the project that conform to its built-in rules (rules include annotations such as @RestController󠁪 or @Controller󠁪, among others). If you do not wish to document every interface, you can disable this default behavior by setting doc-apis.autoGenerate=false󠁪, as mentioned in the previous configuration section. After disabling auto-generation, you can selectively designate which interfaces should be documented using the @DocApi󠁪 annotation.When applied to an interface method, 

@DocApi󠁪 offers additional flexible settings:
- result: Directly declare the return object type. If specified, it overrides the SpringBoot return object.
- stringResult: Use this for returning a string when the response is simple, and creating a dedicated return class is unnecessary.
- url: An extension field for specifying the request URL, useful for non-SpringBoot projects.
- method: An extension field indicating the request method, helpful for non-SpringBoot scenarios.

Example：

```java
@DocApi(result = AdminVO.class, url = "/api/v1/admin/auth", method = "post")
public void someMethod();
```
stringResult󠁪, where the JSON string will be automatically formatted in the documentation:

```java
@DocApi(stringResult = "{code: 200, data: 'success'}")
@GetMapping("custom-json")
public Map<String, Object> customJsonResult() { ... }
```

## @DocIgnore

Ignoring Specific ControllersTo ignore an entire Controller󠁪, simply annotate the class with @DocIgnore

```java
@DocIgnore
public class UserController {
    // ...
}
```
Ignoring Specific MethodsAlternatively, apply @DocIgnore󠁪 to a specific method to exclude just that method from documentation, providing finer control:
```java
@PostMapping("save")
@DocIgnore
public ApiResult saveUser() {
    return null;
}

```

Ignoring Specific FieldsTo exclude a field from being exported in the generated documentation, annotate that field with @DocIgnore:

```java
public class User {
    // ...

    /**
     * Name
     */
    @DocIgnore
    private String name;
}
```

> Special Notes

1. By default, the framework uses the comment content above the Controller󠁪 class as the navigation title in the documentation. However, if the comment includes @description󠁪, that text will be used instead. For example:
```java
/**
 * Demonstrates some special declaration methods
 *
 * @description Administrator Interface
 */
@Controller
public class AdminController {
    // ...
}
```
In this case, the navigation title in the generated documentation will be "Administrator Interface," not "Demonstrates some special declaration methods."

2.Adding @description󠁪 within a method's comments allows you to append a line of additional explanation beneath the interface method. For example:

```java
/**
 * User List
 * @description Frontend developers, please note, all responsibility lies with the frontend.
 */
@PostMapping("/list")
public ApiResult<List<User>> listUser() { ... }
```
Here, the generated documentation will include an extra note under the interface method: "Frontend developers, please note, all responsibility lies with the frontend."
