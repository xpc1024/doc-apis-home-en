## Security

This framework only incorporates three well-known third-party dependencies: springboot, java parser, and fastjson, all of which have been selected to ensure no known security vulnerabilities are present. All internal source code has also been open-sourced, with no identified risks. More crucially, the framework features a zero-intrusion characteristic, meaning that you do not need to package the dependencies into your project. When introducing them, you can specify the scope as test, and the framework will automatically generate API documentation when running the test module. The final deployment package will not contain any included dependencies, ensuring safety from every perspective.

## Performance

The framework can be toggled on or off to trigger asynchronous generation at Springboot project startup without impacting the project's boot speed. Moreover, the generated documentation is entirely static, guaranteeing no effect on project performance.

## Reliability

At its core, the framework reads annotations, code, and other information from the project, synthesizes this data, and then generates API documentation. This process ensures that no extra or erroneous documentation is created, maintaining the integrity of the original content. Compared to traditional methods, the reliability of this approach is significantly enhanced.
