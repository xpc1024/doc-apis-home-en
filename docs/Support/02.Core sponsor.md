## Recruitment of core sponsors

Translation: Doc-apis, as the simplest API documentation generation tool used globally, possesses advantages such as a low barrier to use and a vast user base, thus generating massive traffic. This traffic is further amplified within the company, because an API document is not only utilized by backend developers, but also shared with frontend developers, architects, CTOs, and various other roles within the entire R&D team. During inter-departmental collaborations, it may even circulate across departments within the company. There's only one prime advertising spot on the homepage, and every generated API document will inevitably display this when opened, making it top-tier exposure. Assuming 10,000 companies are using doc-apis, it would result in exposure to at least 10,000 companies. If this exposure volume is then multiplied by all the roles involved in R&D across these companies, the impact will be further magnified...
Translation: We are seeking top-tier sponsors for this platform. Your company is welcome to advertise here. Not only will sponsors receive massive traffic, but they will also have a dedicated booth and a permanent sponsorship record on our official website. The doc-apis development team will remember every company that supports open source initiatives, and we sincerely thank your company for contributing to the global open-source public welfare cause. Respect!
