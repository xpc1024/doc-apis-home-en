This framework partly refers to or directly reuses code from [JApiDoc](https://japidocs.agilestudio.cn/#/), and hereby explicitly acknowledges this fact; the reasons are explained in the Acknowledgments section.The code reused from JApiDoc within this framework still adheres to the Apache-2.0 open-source license. All other original developments, expansions, optimizations, as well as various bug fixes, are governed by the AGPL-3.0 open-source license, which is also indicated in the source code. Individual users and micro-enterprises with a staff size of no more than 10 people can use it free of charge for life. However, medium-sized and large enterprises are required to pay for usage, adopting a tiered pricing model based on the scale of the enterprise. The fees are exceedingly modest. Our objective is not to generate profit but rather to propel open-source projects further and to provide higher quality services and standards, thereby achieving a win-win scenario!
