## Introduction
doc-apis is a genuinely non-intrusive API documentation generation tool. Without adding a single line of code or configuration, and without needing to package it into your project, simply introduce the relevant dependency to your project, click to start, and you can instantly generate web, iOS, and Android interface documentation, complete with powerful features like online debugging.
> **Philosophy** Provide simplicity, usability, and convenience to users, leaving complexity to the silent efforts of the bald ones behind the framework.

> **Vision** Become the world's most popular API documentation tool.

> **Pricing** Free for all individual users and startups with fewer than 10 employees for life. Only a small fee is charged for medium-to-large enterprises to provide superior services and ensure the longevity of the framework.

## Advantages
- **Zero Intrusion:** Unlike frameworks like Swagger, which require additional business code to generate documentation, doc-apis generates API documentation automatically as long as your code complies with standards.
- **Zero Configuration:** For Springboot projects, it takes as few as 0 lines of configuration to automatically generate API documentation. All configurations are designed for ease of use and come with default values, allowing you to configure as needed.
- **Transparent Dependency:** After introduction, it remains completely transparent to the original project without any impact. There's no need to worry about extra risks brought about by introducing third-party dependencies since it doesn't even need to be packaged into the project.
- **Agile Development:** No need to implement the interface; merely define the URL, type, and input/output parameters of the request to generate documentation, facilitating swift development for both front-end and back-end teams.
- **Rich Content:** From request URLs to methods, input and output parameters, all necessary information such as parameter types, mandatory status, and descriptions are clearly presented.
- **Diverse Formats:** Generates various formats such as HTML and MD in one go, simultaneously compatible with WEB, iOS, Android, and other types, adapting to various scenarios.
- **Broad Compatibility:** Whether it's mainstream SpringBoot projects, Spring projects, or niche Jfinal, Play frameworks, etc., compatibility is assured.
- **Powerful Features:**  Supports online debugging, multiple request methods, custom headers, and more, covering all your needs for API documentation and testing in one place.
- **Multi-language** Generates multi-lingual API documentation, with user documentation currently supporting Chinese and English. Contributions for other languages are welcome.
- **Good Compatibility:** Works well with JDK versions from 8 to 21, and SpringBoot from 1.x to 3.x. Compatibility is ensured across all versions for Spring, Jfinal, and other projects.
- **Code Conformity:** Monitors code quality from the source. Unannotated modules and non-Restful style interfaces are clearly identified, encouraging developers to standardize their code.
- **Ease of Use:** Like high-quality ingredients requiring simple cooking, a sophisticated documentation generation framework requires simple operations. From beginner to expert, you can master it in 0 to 5 minutes.
- **Continuous Updates:** ...
